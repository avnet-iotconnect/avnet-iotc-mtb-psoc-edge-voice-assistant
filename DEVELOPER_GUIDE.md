## Introduction

This document demonstrates the steps of setting up the Infineon  PSOC™ Edge MCU boards
for connecting to Avnet's /IOTCONNECT Platform. Supported boards are listed in 
the [README.md](README.md).

## Prerequisites
* PC with Windows. The project is tested with Windows 10, though the setup should work with Linux or Mac as well.
* USB-A to USB-C data cable
* 2.4GHz WiFi Network
* A serial terminal application such as [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) or a browser-based application like [Google Chrome Labs Serial Terminal](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/serial-terminal/)
* A registered [myInfineon Account](https://www.infineon.com/sec/login)

## Hardware Setup
* See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.
* If using the EVK board, ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
  * BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
  * J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position (these should be default)
* Identify the debug USB port for your board from the board's user manual.
* Connect the board's debug port to a USB port on your PC. A new USB device should be detected.
Firmware logs will be available on that COM port.
* Open the Serial Terminal application and configure as shown below:
  * Port: (Select the COM port with the device)
  * Speed: `115200`
  * Data: `8 bits`
  * Parity: `none`
  * Stop Bits: `1`
  * Flow Control: `none`

> before continuing to the steps below.
> Follow the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-c-lib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
> if you are contributing to this project.

- Download [ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/modustoolbox-software/). Install the ***ModusToolbox&trade; Setup*** software. The software may require you to log into your Infineon account. In ***ModusToolbox&trade; Setup*** software, download & install the items below:
  - ModusToolbox&trade; Tools Package 3.9. (3.7 and later should work).
  - ModusToolbox&trade; Edge Protect Security Suite 2.2.0.
  - ModusToolbox&trade; Programming Tools 1.9.0.
  - ModusToolbox&trade; Audio SW Codecs Tech Pack 1.0.3.
  - DEEPCRAFT&trade; Audio Enhancement Tech Pack 1.3.0.
  - Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
- Download and install the [LLVM compiler release-19.1.5](https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm/releases)
  - Set *CY_COMPILER_LLVM_ARM_DIR=[path to LLVM compiler location]() in your environment or explicitly in [common_app.mk](common_app.mk).
  - For example: *C:/llvm/LLVM-ET-Arm-19.1.5-Windows-x86_64*

- Install and set up VS Code per [VS Code for ModusToolbox&trade; guide](https://www.infineon.com/assets/row/public/documents/30/44/infineon-visual-studio-code-user-guide-usermanual-en.pdf).
At the time of writing this guide, it is only required to follow the first few sections
that explain how to install VS Code itself, the required VS Code Plugins and the J-Link Software.
- Launch ModusToolbox&trade; Dashboard. Select Target IDE `Microsoft Visual Studio` 
from the dropdown on top-right and then click *Launch Project Creator*.
- Select one of the supported boards from [README.md](README.md) and click *Next*.
- For the Application(s) Root Path, specify or browse to a directory where the application will be created.
It is preferred to use a short path due to Windows OS file path limits.
- Ensure that the Target IDE is *Microsoft Visual Studio Code*.
- Checkmark this repo's application by browsing Template Applications or searching for this application name. 
We suggest searching for "Avnet" first to reduce the list.
- On Windows, it is recommended to override the New Application Name value to a shorter name 
as well as using a short path in Project Creator. Otherwise, the build may fail due to Windows path length limitations. 
- Click *Create* and close the Project Creator when the project is created successfully.
- Open VS Code, and Select *File -> Open Workspace from File*, navigate to the location of the application that was just
created, select the workspace file, and click *Open*.
- If VS Code does not prompt you to *Trust this project*, click the *Restricted Mode* button in the bottom left of the status bar
and trust the project.
- Depending on your settings in VS Code and VS Code version, you may see a message about trusting the authors. 
If so, click *Yes, I trust the authors*.

- Build the project, select *Terminal -> Run Task*. Then select *Build* from the dropdown.
- To program the project onto the board, connect the board, 
select *Terminal -> Run Task*. Then select *Program* from the dropdown.
- If you wish to debug the project, select *Run > Start Debugging* instead.
- (Optional) While we recommend using the runtime device configuration, please note that the configuration
can be hard-coded in the app_config.h and wifi_config.h files. The device can be created first in /IOTCONNECCT and the 
certificate and private key can be downloaded and set in the app_config.h.
- Open your terminal emulator and monitor the device startup messages. Note the following similar to this one:

```
Generated device unique ID (DUID) is: psoc-edge-va-11012233
```

Record this DUID to use it in the later steps. 

### Create an /IOTCONNECT Account
An /IOTCONNECT account with an AWS backend is required.  If you need to create an account, a free trial subscription is available.
The free subscription may be obtained directly from [iotconnect.io](https://iotconnect.io) or through the AWS Marketplace.

* Option #1 **(Recommended)**   
/IOTCONNECT via [AWS Marketplace](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/subscription/iotconnect_aws_marketplace.md) - 60 day trial; AWS account creation required  


* Option #2  
/IOTCONNECT via [iotconnect.io](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=aws) - 30 day trial; no credit card required

### /IOTCONNECT Device Template Setup

An /IOTCONNECT *Device Template* will need to be created or imported.
* Download the premade [device-template.json](files/device-template.json) 
(Open the link then click the *Download Raw File* icon on the right).
* Import the template into your /IOTCONNECT instance:  [Importing a Device Template](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/import_device_template.md) guide  
> **Note:**  
> For more information on [Template Management](https://docs.iotconnect.io/iotconnect/concepts/cloud-template/) 
> please see the [/IOTCONNECT Documentation](https://iotconnect.io) website.

### /IOTCONNECT Device Creation and Setup

* Create a new device in the /IOTCONNECT portal. (Follow the [Create a New Device](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/create_new_device.md) guide for a detailed walkthrough).
* Enter the *DUID* displayed on the device terminal into the *Unique ID* field (also called Device Unique ID - DUID in this guide).
* Enter the same DUID or descriptive name of your choosing as *Display Name* to help identify your device.
* Select the template from the dropdown box that was just imported.
* Ensure "Use my certificate" is selected under *Device certificate*.

Return to the device terminal and enter your account and Wi-Fi credentials, similar to this:
```
Please enter your device configuration
Platform (aws/az): 
>Platform: aws
CPID: 
>mycpid
Environment: 
>myenv
WiFi SSID: 
>myssid
WiFi Password: 
>mypass
```

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling **local echo** in your terminal settings
> may help when entering the information but may conflict with the output as well,
> depending on which terminal emulator is used.

You should see the device write the configured values and reset. On subsequent boot the device configration and
the certificate will be displayed:
```
Current Settings:
Platform: AWS
DUID: psoc-edge-va-11012233
CPID: mycpid
ENV: myenv
WiFi SSID: myssid
Device certificate:

```
* This information will always be displayed on boot-up. You will also have an option to enter "y" 
at the *Do you wish to configure the device?* prompt to re-configure the values.
* If you wish to re-generate the certificate, issue *Terminal -> Run Task -> Erase* and then program the firmware again.
* Return to the /IOTCCONNECT browser window and copy the device certificate including the BEGIN and END lines.
* Click **Save & View**.

* At this point, the application is set up with /IOTCONNECT credentials and reseting the board should connect it to /IOTCONNECT.
