## Introduction

This document demonstrates the steps of setting up the Infineon  PSOCâ„¢ Edge MCU boards
for connecting to Avnet's /IOTCONNECT Platform. Supported boards are listed in 
the [README.md](README.md).

## Prerequisites
* PC with Windows. The project is tested with Windows 10, though the setup should work with Linux or Mac as well.
* USB-A to USB-C data cable
* 2.4GHz WiFi Network
* A serial terminal application such as [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) or a browser-based application like [Google Chrome Labs Serial Terminal](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/serial-terminal/)
* A registered [myInfineon Account](https://www.infineon.com/sec/login)

## Hardware Setup
* Identify the debug USB port for your board from the board's user manual.
* Connect the board's debug port to a USB port on your PC. A new USB device should be detected.
Firmware logs will be available on that COM port.
* Open the Serial Terminal application and configure as shown below:
  * Port: (Select the COM port with the device)
  * Speed: `115200`
  * Data: `8 bits`
  * Parity: `none`
  * Stop Bits: `1`
  * Flow Control: `none`
  
## Building the Software

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to contribute to this project, work with your own git fork,
> or evaluate an application version that is not yet released, the setup steps will change 
> the setup steps slightly.
> In that case, read [DEVELOPER_LOCAL_SETUP.md](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotc-mtb-basic-example/blob/main/DEVELOPER_LOCAL_SETUP.md)
> (From the PSOC6 Basic Sample repo)
> before continuing to the steps below.
> Follow the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-c-lib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
> if you are contributing to this project.

- Download [ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/modustoolbox-software/). Install the ***ModusToolbox&trade; Setup*** software. The software may require you to log into your Infineon account. In ***ModusToolbox&trade; Setup*** software, download & install the items below:
  - *ModusToolbox&trade; Tools Package* 3.6.
  - *ModusToolbox&trade; Edge Protect Security Suite* 1.6.0.
  - *ModusToolbox&trade; Programming Tools* 1.6.0.
  - Arm GCC Toolchain (GCC) 14.2.1.
  - Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1.105.0 or newer. [(VS Code for ModusToolbox&trade; guide)](https://www.infineon.com/assets/row/public/documents/30/44/infineon-visual-studio-code-user-guide-usermanual-en.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c92416ca50192787be52923b2)

- Launch ModusToolbox&trade; Dashboard. Select Target IDE `Microsoft Visual Studio` 
from the dropdown on top-right and then click *Launch Project Creator*.
- Select one of the supported boards from [README.md](README.md) and click *Next*.
- For the Application(s) Root Path, specify or browse to a directory where the application will be created.
It is preferred to use a short path due to Windows OS file path limits.
- Ensure that the Target IDE is *Microsoft Visual Studio Code*.
- Checkmark this repo's application by browsing Template Applications or searching for this application name.
- It is recommended to override the New Application Name value to a shorter name.
- Click *Create*.
- Close the Project Creator when the project is created successfully.
- Open VS code, and Select *File -> Open Workspace from File*, navigate to the location of the application that was just
created, select the workspace file, and click *Open*.
- Depending on your settings in VS Code, you may see a message about trusting the authors. 
If so, click *Yes, I trust the authors*.

- Once the [Cloud Account Setup](#cloud-account-setup) below is complete,
In the *proj_cm33_ns* project directory modify **app_config.h** per your
/IOTCONNECT device setup and **wifi_config.h** per your WiFi connection settings.

- To build the project, select *Terminal -> Run Task*. Then select *Build* from the dropdown.
- To program the project onto the board, connect the board, 
select *Terminal -> Run Task*. Then select *Program* from the dropdown.
- If you wish to debug the project, select *Run > Start Debugging* instead.


## Cloud Account Setup
An /IOTCONNECT account is required.  If you need to create an account, a free 2-month subscription is available.

Please follow the 
[Creating a New /IOTCONNECT Account](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/subscription/subscription.md)
guide and select one of the two implementations of /IOTCONNECT: 
* [AWS Version](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=aws)  
* [Azure Version](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=azure)  

* Be sure to check any SPAM folder for the temporary password.

### Acquire /IOTCONNECT Account Information

* Login to /IOTCONNECT using the corresponding link below to the version to which you registered:  
    * [/IOTCONNECT on AWS](https://console.iotconnect.io) 
    * [/IOTCONNECT on Azure](https://portal.iotconnect.io)

* The Company ID (**CPID**) and Environment (**ENV**) variables are required to be stored into the device. Take note of these values for later reference.
<details><summary>Acquire <b>CPID</b> and <b>ENV</b> parameters from the /IOTCONNECT Key Vault and save for later use</summary>

</details>


#### /IOTCONNECT Device Template Setup

An /IOTCONNECT *Device Template* will need to be created or imported.
* Download the premade [device-template.json](files/device-template.json) 
(Open the link then click the *Download Raw File* icon on the right).
* Import the template into your /IOTCONNECT instance:  [Importing a Device Template](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/import_device_template.md) guide  
> **Note:**  
> For more information on [Template Management](https://docs.iotconnect.io/iotconnect/concepts/cloud-template/) 
> please see the [/IOTCONNECT Documentation](https://iotconnect.io) website.

#### /IOTCONNECT Device Creation and Setup

* Create a new device in the /IOTCONNECT portal. (Follow the [Create a New Device](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/create_new_device.md) guide for a detailed walkthrough).
* Choose a name for your device and enter it into the *Unique ID* field (also called Device Unique ID - DUID in this guide).
* Enter the same DUID or descriptive name of your choosing as *Display Name* to help identify your device.
* Select the template from the dropdown box that was just imported.
* Ensure "Auto-generated" is selected under *Device certificate*.
* Click **Save & View**.
* In the *Info* panel, click the *Connection Info* hyperink on top right and 
download the certificate by clicking the download icon on the top right
![download-cert.png](media/download-cert.png).
* Provide values for DUID, CPID and ENV from the above steps into the **proj_cm33_ns/app_config.h** file.
* You will need to open the device certificate and private key files and 
provide them in **proj_cm33_ns/app_config.h** in the format specified as a C string #define like so:
  ```
  #define IOTCONNECT_DEVICE_CERT \
  "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n" \

  "khPBBRXBKbDpQ02LgX6tsJUEbGbnPC94LfwnkTuVx/CFKWZfmg==\n" \
  "-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
  ```
* The same format needs to be used for the private key as `#define IOTCONNECT_DEVICE_KEY`

At this point, the application is set up with /IOTCONNECT credentials.
